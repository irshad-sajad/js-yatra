## JavaScript and Classes

## OOP
- a programming paradigm(style)

## what is an object?
- collection of properties and methods
- properties => variables or constants
- methods => simple functions that we use

## why use OOP?
- helps in writing cleaner, more modular, and more scalable code, especially for larger and more complex applications.

## parts of OOP
Object literal => a data type used to define objects in JavaScript.

- Constructor function
- Prototypes
- Classes
- Instances (new, this)

## 4 pillars of OOP
Abstraction 
- hide internal details (eg. fetch)
Encapsulaton
- wraps up the data or hides the inner workings of an object from the outside world.
Inheritance
- allows a new class (child class) to inherit properties and methods from an existing class (parent class). This promotes code reuse and helps in creating hierarchical relationships between classes. 
Polymorphism
- poly means many and morphism means forms. Polymorphism means the same function with different signatures is called many times.
